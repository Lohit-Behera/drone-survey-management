# Drone Survey Management System

## üåê Live Demo

**Live Application**: [https://drone-survey-management.vercel.app](https://drone-survey-management.vercel.app)

## Design Challenge Overview

This project addresses the challenge of designing a scalable system that enables large organizations to plan, manage, and monitor autonomous drone surveys across multiple global sites. The platform simplifies key operations like facility inspections, security patrols, and site mapping by coordinating drone missions remotely and intelligently.

**Note**: This implementation focuses on the critical backbone of drone operations: mission management, real-time monitoring, fleet coordination, and survey reporting. Live video feeds and actual data capture (images/videos/3D maps) are outside the scope of this project.
